## Welcome To My GitHub Pages Website!
My name is Alina Alizai and I am a computer science student at Brooklyn College. I am really excited to be apart of Cuny Tech Preps data science cohort. And I created this website to share my projects and accomplishments with CTP.

## About Me

I really enjoy baking and painting in my free time and would love to work at Google one day because of the culture of the company and all the cool things they offer.
